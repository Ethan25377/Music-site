    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>The story of Isaiah Rashad begins on May 16, 19991, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Growing up, Rashad was primarliy raised by his mother, while his father had left him when he turned three. In those early years, Rashad would stay up with his dad listening to big name artists: Too $hort and Scarface. At a young age, Rashad came up with the decision that he wanted to become a preacher, but his older step-brother stepped in and introduced him to music instead. Rashad began to take music serious when he hit highschool, and would record with his friends whenever given the chance. He began getting connections with big name brands and eventually found his way to success through the signing with Top Dawg Entertainment. This was a score and for Rashad and put him on the map with the other artists, that being SZA, Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, and Zacari just to name a few.</p>
